We identified two consanguineous families with children exhibiting cardiac and craniofacial dysmorphia, with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We found homozygous frameshift variants of CCDC32 in all affected individuals and validated loss-of-function pathogenicity using zebrafish and cell culture models. This syndromic presentation is consistent with the more severe manifestations of ciliopathies, which often present during development.
