We found evidence for a burden of PCM1 pathogenic missense variation in individuals with drug-resistant schizophrenia, which was replicated in a second cohort. PCM1 localizes to the centriolar satellites and is thought to be important for maintaining ciliary integrity. In Pcm1 knockout mice, we found evidence for drug-resistant behavioral abnormalities, as well as lateral ventricle enlargement concomitant with progressive ciliary dysfunction. Systematic zebrafish <i>in vivo<i> complementation with rare alleles identified from our cohorts allowed us to improve our statistical power in differentiating loss-of-function from benign variants. These projects showcases the necessity of differentiating pathogenic verse benign variation <i>in vivo<i>, as we would not have as much confidence linking the cilia to the psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia without those data, along with the mouse model.
