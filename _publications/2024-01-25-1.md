In an especially young cohort of sudden death in young humans, we found excess nonsynonymous variation in both cardiomyopathy and epilepsy-related genes, with the number of epilepsy variants negatively correlated with age of death. These data suggest a polygenic disease liability shared along a neural-cardio axis.
