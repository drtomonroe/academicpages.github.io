  text="<strong>I am a geneticist and developmental biologist <a href='https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/mcnally/members/index.html'>in the McNally lab</a> dedicated to understanding how human DNA sequence variation influences cardiac form and function.</strong> The details of how cells and tissues self-organize with mind-bending fidelity have become increasingly clear, yet we cannot engineer organs de novo. Simultaneously, we have made incredible advances in defining the pieces of the larger puzzle that is complex inheritence, but we remain woefully inadequate at predicting outcomes from genotypes alone. The crux of these issues is our nascent understanding of cis and trans genetic interactions. My work is in pursuit of a better understanding of how cells integrate gene expression and gene function across space and time. I am driven by a central ethos that understanding how cells interpret DNA to form healthy humans will lead to innovation that improves the quality of human life."
