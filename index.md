# Approach

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Statistical approaches to identify candidate deleterious variants.</strong> Rationally designed drugs with a strong basis in human genetics have repeatedly been proven to be more likely to gain FDA approval. Therefore, I focus my attention on discovering novel genetic components of disease. My approach is to identify highly penetrant variants passed down within families, and separately, look for inflation of common variants in more common diseases. I am keenly interested in how rare and common genetic variants interact to modify disease presentation, and how cumulative genetic burden amounts to a continuum of causality.</li>
  </ul>

 <ul>
    <li><strong>Testing the pathogenicity of those candidates.Testing the pathogenicity of those candidates.</strong> Of course, statistical inference is not enough to infer pathogenicity of novel loci. The early days of human genetics were fraught with imperfect assumptions about causality and genetic misattributions. Therefore, a critical component of my work is validation of candidate alleles. Usually, this means using animal models, or more recently, human-engineered tissues. All models are imperfect, so each decision is based on careful consideration of the appropriateness of the validation system. My preferred approach is to use orthogonal models and assay for convergent lines of evidence. Of course, statistical inference is not enough to infer pathogenicity of novel loci.
