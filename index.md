  text="<strong>I am a geneticist dedicated to understanding how human DNA variation influences cardiac form and function.</strong> The details of how cells and tissues self-organize with mind-bending fidelity have become increasingly clear, yet we cannot engineer organs ex utero. Simultaneously, we have made incredible advances in defining the pieces of the larger puzzle that is complex inheritence, but we remain woefully inadequate at predicting outcomes from genetics alone. The crux of these issues is our nascent understanding of cis and trans genetic interactions. My work is in pursuit of a better understanding of how cells integrate gene expression and gene function across space and time. I am driven by a human life <strong>central ethos that understanding how cells interpret DNA to form healthy humans will lead to innovations that improve the quality of human life.</strong>
