  text="<strong>I am a geneticist and developmental biologist <a href='https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/mcnally/members/index.html'>in the McNally lab</a> dedicated to understanding how human DNA sequence variation influences cardiac form and function.</strong> Inherent to that pursuit is a celebration of our shared humanity given that we differ in a vanishingly low proportion of our total DNA content. However, the promise of personalized medicine will only be fulfilled by studying those subtle differences that help shape our individuality."
