I am a geneticist dedicated to understanding how human genetic variation influences cardiac form and function. I specialze the design and implementation of tractible experiments that test hypotheses generated from personal and population genetics observations. This approach sorts into three primary of investigation:
<br>
1. <b>Using statistical approaches to identify candidate</b> deleterious variants. Ratioanlly-designed drugs with a strong basis in human genetics have repeatedly been proven to be more likely to make FDA approval. Therefore, I focus my attention towards discovering novel genetic components of disease. My approach is to identify highly penetrant variants passed down within families, and separately, look for inflation of common variants in more common diseases. I am keenly interested in how rare and common genetic variants interact to modify disease presentation, and how cumulative genetic burden amounts to a continuum of causality. 
<br>
2. <b>Testing the pathogenicity of those candidates.</b> Of course, statistical inference is not enough to infer pathogenicity of novel loci. The early days of human genetics were fraught with imperfect assumptions about causality and genetic misattributions. Therefore, a critical componant to my work is validation of candidate alleles. Usually, this means using animal models, or more recently, human engineered tissues. All models are imperfect, so each decision is based on careful consideration of the appropriateness of the validation system. My preferred approach is to use orthogonal models and assay for convergent lines of evidence.
<br>
3. <b>Using that knowledge to more clearly understand disease-causing mechanisms.</b> Once we identify a candidate variant and test whether or not it is pathogenic, the next step is to understand why. Even pathogenic variants within the same gene can have divergent molecular consequences. Pathogenicity within one gene can be on a scale from loss-of-function to overexhuberance, or even deviant neofunctionalization. Therefore, in order to understand the genesis and course of disease, it is critical to understand the proximal molecular consequences stemming from mutation.
