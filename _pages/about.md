I am a cardiac geneticist dedicated to understanding how human genetic variation influences cardiac form and function. I specialze the design and implementation of tractible experiments that test hypotheses generated from personal and population genetics. This approach sorts into three primary of investigation:
\
1. Using statistical approaches to identify candidate deleterious variants.
\
2. Testing the pathogenicity of those candidates
\
3. Using that knowledge to improve the fidelity and predictive capacity of genetic diagnoses
