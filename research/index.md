   <p>I specialize in designing and implementing tractable experiments to test hypotheses generated from personal and population genetics observations. I am particularly interested in genetic heart disease and the variable expressivity that characterizes these conditions. Key to this work is the discovery, validation, and mechanistic mapping of high and low impact genetic variants. I believe that understanding and integrating these mechanisms is the future of human genetics research, and that better predictive models, backed by refined molecular pathomechanisms, will revolutionize the prevention and treatment of cardiomyopathies. My role can be divided into three main areas of investigation:

# Approach

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Statistical approaches to identify candidate deleterious variants.</strong> Rationally designed drugs with a strong basis in human genetics have repeatedly been proven to be more likely to gain FDA approval. Therefore, I focus my attention on discovering novel genetic components of disease. My approach is to identify highly penetrant variants passed down within families, and separately, look for inflation of common variants in more common diseases. I am keenly interested in how rare and common genetic variants interact to modify disease presentation, and how cumulative genetic burden amounts to a continuum of causality.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
 
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Testing the pathogenicity of those candidates.</strong> Of course, statistical inference is not enough to infer pathogenicity of novel loci. The early days of human genetics were fraught with imperfect assumptions about causality and genetic misattributions. Therefore, a critical component of my work is validation of candidate alleles. Usually, this means using animal models, or more recently, human-engineered tissues. All models are imperfect, so each decision is based on careful consideration of the appropriateness of the validation system. My preferred approach is to use orthogonal models and assay for convergent lines of evidence.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Using that knowledge to more clearly understand disease-causing mechanisms.</strong> Once we identify a candidate variant and test whether or not it is pathogenic, the next step is to understand why. Even pathogenic variants within the same gene can have divergent molecular consequences. Pathogenicity within one gene can range from loss-of-function to overexuberance, or even deviant neofunctionalization. Therefore, in order to understand the genesis and course of disease, it is critical to understand the proximal molecular consequences stemming from mutation.</li>
