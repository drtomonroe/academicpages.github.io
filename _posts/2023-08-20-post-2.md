# NHLBI K99 is active

Great news. The NHLBI selected my K99, "Mechanisms linking the frail sarcomere to noncompaction cardiomyopathy" for funding. This award
 will help us use engineered tissues to understand how myosin heavy chain variants influence cardiomyocyte maturation - linking developmental
 pathways to sarcomere integrity.
